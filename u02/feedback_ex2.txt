	1) Perfect
	
	2) Nice use of methods and loops. However, on line 8 you are writing the code in the constructor
	   of the class. The constructor shouldn't be used to methods/print statements; it is more for defining attributes. 
	   The constructor always has exactly the same name as your class.You will learn more about this later in the course.
	   I would recommend doing this instead of using the class:
	   
	   public class ForwardAndBackward {
    
    		public static void main(String[] args) {
        		 forwardAndBackward();
    		}
		    
		    public static void forwardAndBackward(){
		    	//your code
		 	}
    
    		String helper(int n, String m) {
		    	//your code
    		}

		}		
	    
	    If you are calling a method from the "main" function, then the method called must have the word static in it.
	    
	    
	   
		
	3) Same problem as in exercise 2; you should out the code on line 10 in a method.
	   Also I don't recommend initiating variables outside of methods(line 4/6) yet because 
	   we havn't talked a lot about classes yet.

4) very cool way of solving shared digit
	your getMax is correct. Great job
5) you statements are correct, but make sure to make statements about as many variables as possible in 1. we can state that x>10
