5) Scrabble: Your code prints out the correct output. However, instead of making a new class of itself
			Scrabble s = new Scrabble();, leave that out and just make your other methods static. It's not
			good practice to use classes like that. Also be careful when you define variables outside a method
			like on line 9 and 10. It is better if you passed them through as a parameter in a method. You will
			learn more about classes later. Other than that, well done! 	
	

7) 
	1. check the master solution and try and understand the solution.
	2. You only need the condition for n because m is dependent on n.
	3. correct

6) checksum: All correct.
	magic7: Almost all correct, Math.abs(a + b) should just be a+b. If a = 7 and b= -14, your code returns true
			but it should be false.
	
	fast12: I would recommend using || instead of |. Also
			return (z % 12 <= 2 | z % 12 >= 10)? true : false;
			can just be written as return (z % 12 <= 2 | z % 12 >= 10) without checking the conditions,
			it is the same.
