EBNF
	1) Very good
	
	2) Nicely done :)
	
	3) In this exercise for every X there should a pair of Ys. That means the YY should not be 
	separated like XYX. This is not very clear on the exercise sheet. so rule <c> should be taken out.
	Also, in your definition, XYYYYX would not be valid. You can fix it by adding the repetition brackets
	around the <x2ygemisch rule>:
		<x2ygemisch> <= {<a> | <b>}   and don't forget the <> brackets everytime you use the name of a rule.
